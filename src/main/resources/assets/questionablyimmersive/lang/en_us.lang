ie.manual.entry.cokeOvenBattery0=Mundane <link;cokeOven;§o§nCoke §o§nOvens§r> are useful for producing small amounts of coal coke, but their bulky form factor makes mass production a hassle. With the help of some steel, you can squeeze the production of many Coke Ovens into a single expandable Coke Oven Battery. This structure is uniquely variable in size - while the most basic Coke Oven Battery contains 6 ovens, building the battery larger will add additional ovens.
ie.manual.entry.cokeOvenBattery1=The Coke Oven Battery is built as above - but the width can be increased from 6 blocks to up to 250. To form the multiblock, right click the lower light engineering block.
ie.manual.entry.cokeOvenBattery2=Coal or log inputs for each oven can be inserted in the blue port on the oven's top, while creosote is output on the orange side ports. Each oven's output is dumped out the door. While each operation takes longer than the base Coke Oven, each oven can process up to 9 inputs in parallel, leading to a greater throughput. The smallest Coke Oven Battery then has over 6 times the throughput of a base Coke Oven, at the cost of slightly less creosote production.
